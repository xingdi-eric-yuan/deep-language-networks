    A student is completing a task that requires producing a text output from a text input. The student receives an instruction that describes how to produce the output given each input.
    The student has made some errors. Your task is to improve the instruction such that the student can avoid similar errors in the future.

    These are some examples where the student produced the correct outputs.
    {% for backward_info in backward_infos %} {% if backward_info.loss == 0.0 %}
    ## Input {{ loop.index }}:
    {{ backward_info.input }}
    ## Correct Output {{ loop.index }}:
    {{ backward_info.target }}
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}

    These are some examples where the student made errors.
    {% for backward_info in backward_infos %} {% if backward_info.loss > 0.0 %}
    ## Input {{ loop.index }}:
    {{ backward_info.input }}
    ## Student Output {{ loop.index }}:
    {{ backward_info.output }}
    ## Correct Output {{ loop.index }}:
    {{ backward_info.target }}
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}

    This was the instruction you want to improve based on.
    Instruction:
    {{ prompt }}

    Improve the above instruction to fix the student errors.
