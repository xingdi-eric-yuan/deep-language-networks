    A student is completing a task that requires producing a text output from a text input. The student receives an instruction that describes how to produce the output given each input. The student has made some errors. Your task is to improve the old instruction such that the student can fix the errors. 

    Below are some examples where the student solved the task correctly with the old instruction.
    {% for _info in prompt_update_infos %} {% if _info.loss == 0 %}
    ## Input:
    {{ _info.input }}
    ## Correct Output:
    {{ _info.target }}
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}

    Below are some examples where the student made mistakes with the old instruction.
    {% for _info in prompt_update_infos %} {% if _info.loss != 0 %}
    ## Input:
    {{ _info.input }}
    ## Student Output:
    {{ _info.output }}
    ## Correct Output:
    {{ _info.target }}
